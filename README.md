As a Computer Science Engineering student, I have applied my Java programming skills in various projects and academic activities.Additionally, I have worked on networking-based applications using Java’s Socket Programming. I implemented a simple client-server model to understand the fundamentals of secure data transmission. This project helped me grasp concepts like TCP/IP communication, handling multiple client requests, and implementing basic encryption techniques for secure data exchange.Java’s role in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) has also been crucial in my learning journey. While working on various projects, I implemented abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to design scalable and maintainable code structures.  Through these applications, I have gained hands-on experience in Java development, enhancing my programming logic, debugging skills, and software design knowledge. These skills have prepared me for real-world software development and cybersecurity-related challenges, making Java an essential tool in my technical expertise.
